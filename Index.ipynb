    "The **ocean-case-studies** module consists of a series of Jupyter Notebooks that reflect one or more facets of a marine case study, as published on the EUMETSAT website. Though ancillary data sources may be used, the notebooks focus on the use of Copernicus Marine data from Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-6 provided by EUMETSAT. Many of the cases are highlight specific uses of individual sensors, while others are linked to \n",
