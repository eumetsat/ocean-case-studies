    "\n",
    "Concurrent with the past century's persistent warming of global oceans, marine heatwaves (periods of extreme regional ocean warming) have become more frequent and more extreme (Laufk√∂tter et al., 2020). They occur in many areas around the world, from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea and threaten marine biodiversity and its ecosystems (Smale et al., 2019). One particular ecosystem impacted by marine heatwaves, are coral reefs. These heatwaves can, for example, cause coral bleaching, coral disease outbreaks, and/or algae blooms (Roberts et al., 2019). Although coral can survive these so-called bleaching events, they become more stressed, more susceptible to diseases, and, on the long-term, subject to mortality (NOAA, 2021).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will work through an example of how you can access near-real-time data to view current SST in a region that is often affected by marine heatwaves. We will then look at this area in a long term context using a reprocessed time series, to see how the current situation compares to historical marine heat wave episodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook builds on the **<a href=\"https://www.eumetsat.int/Marine-heatwave-intensification-threatens-coral-reef-health\" target=\"_blank\">Marine heatwave intensification threatens coral reef health</a>** case study, and will replicate the figures 3, 5 and 6 using Level-2 data from the Copernicus Sentinel-3 SLSTR sensor and Level-4 data from the Level-4 global OSTIA record. You can find more information on these in the links above.\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the **<a href=\"https://www.oceandecade.org/\" target=\"_blank\">United Nations Ocean Decade</a>**, ten specific challenges are being addressed. This work, and the data underlying it, support \"Challenge 2 - Protect and restore ecosystems and biodiversity\". Data on marine heatwaves can help characterise the stressors facing marine ecosystems under climate changes, and contribute to decision making to protect, manage and restore those affected.\n",

With NRT we do not have all the information we have in hindsight, particularly about instrument characterisation, but this data is vitally important for understanding events that are happening right now. So, for example, you would not use combined NRT and reprocessed data sets for long-term trend analysis, and you would want to consider NRT measurements with a higher degree of uncertainty that you might consider with reprocessed data. So whilst we can use the NRT data now to get an indication of whether this is event is looking like it might be significant, we would eventually want to use a longer term time series that have been reprocessed, to establish how unusual this is event is in a more climatic context.\n",
